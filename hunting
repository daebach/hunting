Hunting Tips and Areas
=============

This scroll is intended to provide a measure of advice regarding where
best to hunt at particular level stages. Rather than going purely by
level alone, this scroll utilises health ranges as the primary measure
of ability. This is because given denizen health, it is often a
necessity to be able to "tank" a denizen while you wear down their
health. While it is possible to increase your attack speed (particularly
for Shaman swiftcursing) to the point where you will deal enough damage
to slay your target before they can overcome your health, such a method
is risky, for obvious reasons!

Now, some general guidelines:

1) Always PROBE your target before attacking them, if they do not look
like they belong (e.g. a giant winged panther in Blackrock). You do not
want to kill someone's pet by accident, as it is extremely expensive to
buy a new one (especially if the pet is not collared or immortal). When
probing, check to see who the denizen is loyal to and type HONOURS
(Name) to check if it belongs to a player. If it does, DO NOT KILL IT!
Killing somebody's pet or mount (incuding minipets) will give them cause
to track you down and kill you in revenge. If it doesn't belong to a
player, however, then by all means get your experience and send it to
Lord Thoth's realm.

2) You should also ensure that you do not attack the denizens or guards
of a city. This will also show up when you PROBE them. Bear in mind that
city guards are often designed, and placed, in such a way that they are
quite capable of killing dragons. Be careful!

3) If you see that the denizens are loyal to a village or someone, it is
very likely that if there is another loyal denizen in the same room,
they will team you. For example, gnolls in Manara will join forces to
defend one another, as will Vertani in Tir Murannn. Probing will help
you to see this, as well as how powerful the mobs are. HELP CONSIDER
will give you the scale on how powerful they are. Do remember that the
might you are able to see is on an absolute and not relative scale.

4) You should be sure to CITY RELATIONS <village> to ensure that you do
not inadvertently find yourself attacking a village or town allied to a
particular city. This can result in your being enemied to some cities,
especially Ashtan and Mhaldor.

5) Remember too that there is no shame in running away when you are
about to die. Now, if you find that you are regularly using hit and run
tactics on a denizen (entering the room, attacking once or twice, then
leaving), then while this is a method of hunting, it is by no means an
efficient one, or useful one, except in certain outlier cases. For
example, in Annwyn, the Sidhe and Unsidhe Court will often have two or
three in each room. If you cannot handle at least a 2-3 stack of these
denizens, then you should not be hunting them. You'll get more efficient
experience (and probably gold) for your efforts elsewhere.

6) If you can, get hunting runes on yourself. These are Jera for + 1
CON, Algiz for 10% reduction in damage, and Berkana for increased health
regeneration. Generally other Eleusians or Kin should be willing to rune
you, provided you have the inks (note that Jera + Algiz + Berkana will
require a purple ink, green ink, and three yellow inks), but you can
also go to the Market channel if nobody is available. Additional runes
are Gebu and Gebo for + 7 to cutting and blunt for your armor, if you're
a Runewarden.

6a) If you haven't yet chosen a racial specialisation, do so (HELP
RACIAL SPECIALISATION). This will provide you +2 to a particular ability
score, along with a corresponding -1 to another. Different classes will
have different focus scores (such as Intelligence for Sylvans versus
Strength for Runewardens), so if you're unsure exactly what would be the
most beneficial to you, don't be afraid to ask. These specialisations
are also useful in combat against other adventurers, for obvious
reasons.

7) Make sure to utilise tattoos. Good hunting tattoos are Moss, Boar,
Moon and Shield. Against affliction-heavy denizens, you'll also want a
Tree tattoo, in addition to a set of curing reflexes and healing (HELP
CURING SYSTEM). Also, never forget your nifty class specific defences
that can mark the difference between life and death. For example, Druids
possess Vigour and Panacea, any Grove user can FLAIL STAFF if they have
the Quarterstaff ability, Runewardens can use room-placed runes to heal
themselves and others, and so on and so forth.

8) Make sure to check HHELP BATTLERAGE for ways and means to utilise
this powerful ability in your hunting.

9) If you die, don't sweat it. Death happens to the best of us from time
to time. You may or may not want to use a starburst tattoo (as long as
after bursting you can run away fast enough to survive), and often
citymates or housemates will be willing to run for your body and
subsequently resurrect you (either in a grove, the Flame, or similar).
Even if you have to EMBRACE DEATH, however, don't worry. Just get back
in the saddle, learn from what went wrong, and go back to work!

10) The original form of this list was constructed before the emergence
of the Battlerage skill and the changes accompanying that. While much of
the list should still remain intact, if you think that an area should be
adjusted, please send a message to the current Huntsmaster/Mistress,
found within HOUSE STRUCTURE, (containing your level, class, any
artifacts
you possess, and how difficult you found the area), and they'll look
into
adjusting that area's position.
